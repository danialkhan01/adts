Ever since I was a child I have been
fascinated by the ephemeral nature of
relationships of the elderly and how we
can live longer together. I want to assist
them by working in this project with all I
have to offer.

    Study philosophy:
 When faced with challenges inside and
    outside of my comfort zone I will tackle
    them and try to reach the limit of my
    potential. Especially when facing
    situations in which I can choose to step
    out of my comfort zone, I will make the
    choice for the uncomfortable. I will try my
    best and be kind to myself when it comes
    to accepting the results that I achieve,
    whether I find them disappointing.
    <br>
    Relationships philosophy:
I will strive to maintain healthy boundaries.
I will try to apply introspection regularly to
measure where I can improve when
dealing with other people. I will not
manipulate nor knowingly step on other
peopleâ€™s boundaries, and I will not give in
to being stepped over my own
boundaries. I will apply communication
and epistemology to solve conflicts.

    I became a student because I was
    fascinated by the theoretical possibilities
    of technological creations. My personal
    stakes and philosophy involve squeezing
    all the potential with the tools we have
    been giving in order to create a better
    place one product at a time

    My work explores the relationship
between the challenges of ageing and
midlife mindfulness at the intersection of
achievement. With both personal
experience and influences as diverse as
a father and a grandfather, new
synergies are synthesised from both
personal and external experiences.
Ever since I was a teenager I have been
fascinated by the essential unreality of
the human condition. What starts out as
triumph soon becomes finessed into a
spaghetti of daily lifestyle challenges,
the stubbornness of ageing, leaving only
a sense of failing and the possibility of a
new synthesis.

    I am very open minded and believe that
there are no limits to our imagination. My
creativity flows through my veins every
time I work on something that I love and
have a burning passion for. This of
course- reflects our products that I
participated with. <br>
Often when there is a problem, I will
always find a new way to solve it. As a
teen still, I feel like there's a lot of potential
left for me to shine even brighter. I always
tell myself to work hard constantly, but
that doesn't mean we can take it easy
from time to time.<br>
I always find new challenges inspiring, it
will help me improve and accomplish
greater goals in the future, as a team or
alone.
